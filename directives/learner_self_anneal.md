# Learner Self-Anneal Directive

## Objective
Continuously improve system performance by learning from feedback and self-correcting.

## Input
- User feedback on generated emails
- Corrections and edits made to drafts
- Performance metrics (open rates, reply rates)
- Error logs and edge cases

## Process
1. Collect feedback from all sources
2. Analyze patterns in corrections
3. Identify common failure modes
4. Extract successful patterns
5. Update prompt templates
6. Adjust personalization rules
7. Refine quality thresholds
8. Test improvements on validation set
9. Deploy updates incrementally

## Output
- Updated prompts and templates
- Refined validation rules
- Performance improvement report
- A/B test configurations
- Learning insights document

## Error Handling
- Conflicting feedback → Prioritize by source reliability
- Insufficient data → Wait for more samples
- Performance regression → Rollback changes
- Overfitting → Apply regularization techniques

## Success Criteria
- Measurable improvement in key metrics (>5%)
- Reduction in manual corrections needed
- Fewer edge case failures
- Maintained or improved email quality scores
- Changes are reversible and trackable
